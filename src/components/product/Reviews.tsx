            I was a bit nervous to be buying a secondhand phone from Amazon, but
            I couldnâ€™t be happier with my purchase!! I have a pre-paid data plan
            so I was worried that this phone wouldnâ€™t connect with my data plan,
            since the new phones donâ€™t have the physical Sim tray anymore, but
            couldnâ€™t have been easier! I bought an Unlocked black iPhone 14 Pro
            Max in excellent condition and everything is PERFECT. It was super
            easy to set up and the phone works and looks great. It truly was in
            excellent condition. Highly recommend!!!ðŸ–¤
